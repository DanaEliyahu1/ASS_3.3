        Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, is a Mediterranean and cosmopolitan city with Roman remains, medieval quarters and the most beautiful examples of 20th century Modernism and avant-garde.
        <br>
        It is no surprise that emblematic constructions by the Catalan architects Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Doménech i Montaner have been declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.
        <br>
        The city's origins are Roman, and its long history and economic dynamism have made Barcelona a cultural city,
        <br>
        which can be seen in the historic-artistic heritage and the promotion of the most innovative artistic trends.
        <br>
        A wide cultural programme will take visitors to museums, exhibitions, open-air sculptures… and many concerts, plays and dances.
